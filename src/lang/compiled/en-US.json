  "At a young age, I can be seen tinkering with whatever I put my mind to. I was so fascinated at the idea of creating anything with the power of programming, and the passion burns strong since. I have dabbled in various hobby projects relating to game development, web design and content creation. Currently, I work remotely as a frontend dev and designer for Minswap DEX on the Cardano blockchain. In my spare time, I like to draw and play rhythm games.": [

Cats are resilient, loving, intelligent yet whimsical and they are more aware of the existence of higher beings, things of greater good. If granted sentience, I believe they can create better worlds than we do. That is a narrative I'd like to bring in my illustrations, as a motivation for myself, and hopefully for others to explore and learn for the betterment of society.": [

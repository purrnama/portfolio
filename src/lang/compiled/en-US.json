  "At a young age, I can be seen tinkering with whatever I put my mind to. I was so fascinated at the idea of creating anything with the power of programming, and the passion burns strong since. I have dabbled in various hobby projects relating to game development, web design and content creation. Currently, I work remotely as a frontend dev and designer for Minswap DEX on the Cardano blockchain. In my spare time, I like to draw and play rhythm games.": [

I was in his dream that night, he told me he got played for a fool, like a damn fiddle.

they watched him as he let loose

a safe space they said, as they dragged him there. He was already uncomfortable the moment more people started showing up.

he felt like a mere acquaintance among a group of tightknit friends.

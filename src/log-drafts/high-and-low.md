Studying in an international university, I am always stirring in a melting pot of cultural differences. This foreign atmosphere is not new to me, considering I've studied abroad in Germany for almost a year.

Seldomly but surely, I encounter several arguments and conflicts, especially during tense phases of a group assignment. I try to avoid conflicts as much as I can, but stuff does happen.

Perhaps context is in order. I usually volunteer to lead on most of my group assignments, and my job is simply to delegate tasks to other members, making sure everyone was accountable with the task they were assigned to. Group members for this particular assignment is picked at random, and its usually a mix of local and international people.

Taking pieces of what I experienced in Germany, I highly value direct communication among my team members. I think its best that we move fast and leave emotions out of the way in getting the job done.

And here is where the conflict begins. It was Ramadhan at the time, and usually, Muslims focus on praying during the final few nights of the month. A team member, who has a Middle Eastern background, did not complete their task for this reason and they only messaged me at the last minute.

I was somewhat displeased by this, given that I specifically told them to tell anything it advance, so I replied with a strict tone, letting them know what consequences this will bring to the assignment as a whole.

Apparently, they took great offense to this and started lashing out, exposing my private messages with him to the group chat. I had nothing to hide to begin with, so I wasn't afraid, just starkly confused by what has unfolded. Nonetheless, I had no choice but to compromise and redelegate their task in order to finish the assignment, and it was concluded from there. Luckily.

To this day, I often think about that event, and what was the missing link that could explain what went wrong.

If I decided to leave everything behind and start anew, am I beginning or have I failed?

Am I letting go or am I running away?

I have given up, should I be at peace or will it engulf me.

What does it take to give up in a good way?

...

Does it have to be like this?

Pretend it doesn't exist?

What should I do to co-exist?

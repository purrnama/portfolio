A stream of stagnancy, a spark of ecstacy, a sense of sanctuary, a flash of animosity, a rapture of reality, return to stagnancy.

It only takes a small drop of stone in the stagnant water that ripples into a world of wonder, unimaginable, unthinkable.

A fleeting sense of belonging, yet it only takes another drop that breaks everything apart. Till it returns back to monotony.

And what do you see? A mirror, reflecting back to its viewer, reminding them of how they've been.

This is the second time, they've seen this mirror. One bigger than the before.

...

Was it their choice? Perhaps it wasn't a stone that dropped, it was themselves. Out of bliss, out of mishap.

Won't they choose to fix it, or perhaps it was mere futile attempts to let the illusion last just a little longer.

In the end, they were left to themselves.

If only they look beyond the reflection to see the wonders in the depths ever-flowing, ever-living.

Until then, they only hope to find another stone to drop into the stagnant water.

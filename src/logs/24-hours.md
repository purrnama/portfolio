I should be getting to work now but I have the urge to write.

Everyone has the same 24 hours a day, the same amount of time to spend each day.

I try to take as much benefit each day as possible. I believe these few years of my youth is the time I need to fully take advantage of.

But my pursuit for various knowledge towards creative work is often at a cost of my time I needed to spend on my main academic route.

Those unfamiliar of cutting edge tech have to some degree an advantage over me, for their minds are focused on just one thing.

Is this a proper way of assessing the situation? What am I comparing between my peers? Or should I not be comparing at all in the first place?

...

How would I perceive as a success in life? Perhaps to find a perfect balance between the financial stability and the joy of research and passion. To pursue what I love without worrying I could not compensate it.

Maybe success varies between people. Everyone progresses at a rate proportional to the weight of the goal.

Maybe there's something more waiting for me if I aim higher than everyone else. and with that I have to perform above and beyond.

These are exciting times. The next chapters of my life are coming closer every second.

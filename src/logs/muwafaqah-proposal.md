I am writing this report to document my research and thought process of making my very own DIY self-hosted home server.

Some years ago, I salvaged the family photos spanning since the beginning of our lives that were dormant in the drive of our dying 2011 iMac. We didn't have any spare drives to store them at the time, so my mother got a Google Drive plan, and that's where all the photos are now since.

Lately my trust for megacorpos have been growing pretty wary, what with all the numerous controversies of [insert any large company] abusing privacy and consent loopholes to scrape as much data as they can. It will only get worse from here on out, so I believe its best that I take the right few steps towards self-owning our own data.

I've been watching Jeff Geerling's Raspberry Pi projects and I'm very intrigued by the potential of its uses for such a small and efficient package. With the right hardware, you can make a tiny home server that sips very little power. It would be a great opportunity for me to learn Linux from a sysadmin point of view.

I've also watched numerous videos about NextCloud from various Linux youtubers like TechHut. With it you can basically do anything you would do wih Google Drive, but all the data is stored in your very own server, and not Google's.

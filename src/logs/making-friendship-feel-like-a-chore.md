I think a lot about what it means to be friends. What does it take to be a good friend? Do each of us have something to gain from each other? Could the relationship flourish into something more, or just stay the same?

It depends, of course. It's unpredictable what kind of connection you end up having with another person. You might come across a turning point in a series of events that reveal each other's true intentions, and the truth is often heart-wrenching as much as it is relieving.

I would often talk a lot about what I've been feeling with friends. I always thought honesty is the way we can build trust on each other. Though in retrospect, its one thing to own up to your mistakes, but to dwell on it for too long is another. I'd get threatened for straining this friendship since I refused to move on.

The kerfuffle in my head was a little too stormy since then, and I could only think of getting away, and I did. I needed time to reflect on what I did and how I behaved. Perhaps I was too vulnerable to them, and yet the feeling was not reciprocated. I came to terms that nobody actually ever cares for you so much, and I say that in the most positive of connotations.

Until we meet again, my heart and mind remain tempered by this fact. Who knows, when unpredictability takes a different direction would I be open to vulnerability once more.

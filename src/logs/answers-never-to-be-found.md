There are some little details in life, unanswered questions that you never seem to know the answer to.

Many moons ago, I heard from a teacher of mine, that I should pray to God to make me someone who always searches for something.

I never gotten a chance to ask what is that 'something' exactly. It was a brief tangent, but somehow it this has stuck with me ever since.

I never seem to forget it in my prayers. It became a principle, a guiding light, of which I'm simply filled with curiosity of. Whatever it is that my heart yearns for, be it knowledge, or purpose, I will try strive for it.

Days go by, and I met many other teachers. I tried asking them about this question, of what it is in that prayer that I should search for. I've gotten no answer.

If I come across a moment when I could meet my old teacher again, perhaps he could finally give me the answer I needed.

And so I did. I was invited to a reunion with my old classmates in middle school, and we had a chance to visit our teachers that day.

I met the teacher that I yearn for all this time, and in little moment I had, I ask him about that prayer. What is that something? What is it that I am looking for?

My heart sanked as he chuckled awkwardly, saying he simply had no idea what I was talking about.

It has been almost 5 years since I left the school. 5 years, I wandered aimlessly with a question in my head that came from an off-topic discussion, telling me to look for something that I never really know what it really is.

There are just questions that simply cannot be answered, but perhaps now, an affirmative unknowable answer is enough relieve this burden of curiosity.

And I will always continue searching for that something that I don't know, because that something, to me is everything that I love and yearn for.

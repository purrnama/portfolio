Thank you for listening to me.

When people grew tired of my persistent troubles.

When advice feels like a broken record.

When I was happy, and when I was withering in bed.

When I've forgotten about you, and when I scrambled to pick up the pieces of where we left of.

When it felt like there is no hope.

You have never given up on me.

When I came crawling, you came walking.

When I came walking, you came running.

The Listener of my pleas and sorrows.

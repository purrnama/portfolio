Sometimes I really just don't how things could ever work out.

I'm on my second year of my degree in Software Engineering, and on the side I also freelancing as an illustrator. I enjoy both programming and doing art.

As much as I try to convince myself that I can somehow blend the two together, in reality they're just oil and water.

For the most part, it's only me allocating my time of the day for study and hobby, and in the end, one will outshine the other.

I even questioned if I would drop the idea of being serious about doing art entirely, but that's a slippery slope that I really don't want to slide down.

For now, I'm grateful of getting a few design commissions every now and then that pays well. I always thought that being an artist means accepting multiple commissions a month as a goal, but it turns out working on less frequent, higher paying projects can work too. It's mostly about figuring out how much time you're willing to spend, and price accordingly.

I'll keep my opportunities open for anything, be it from programming or art, they're the only things that I'm really passionate about.

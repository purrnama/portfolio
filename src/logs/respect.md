I've been to many classes, and I've met a lot of lecturers. Each of them has their own quirks and behaviour.

But generally, they're trying their best to imbue any sort of knowledge to you, and that amounts to a substantial level of respect.

And there is a form of responsibility on my end, as a student, to simply play along in the moment, being active in class and just speaking out your thoughts.

I noticed when I look left and right among my peers, and they're just minding their own business, on their laptop working on assignments and simply avoid talking at all. Sure, they're free to do what they please, but the lack of respect and manners will one day be repaid in one form or another.

There is worth in every person and their every kindness, and they should be acknowledged for it.

Pieces featuring Van has always been mystical and intimate. I experimented on a very dark setting with one warm light source. Her staring eyes reflect this light. One commenter said they could see the life in her, which I find very intriguing.

A common theme in my projects is I wanted to instill empathy towards my characters. I wanted this triumphs and hardships in this alternate world to feel real, not tangible, but ironically _human_.

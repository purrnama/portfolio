The worldbuilding of this alternate world takes place in a futuristic ancient world. A post-apocalyptic rebirth if you will. It makes my mind wander over the possibilities of fusing together different eras of technology.

Beside Van is a very obscure character of mine named Emmie the Scottish Fold. She appears during moments of crisis in my life. She is not necessarily a bad person herself, but rather a comforting friend during hard times.

A key concept that I often associate with my characters are the 7 capital virtues and the 7 deadly sins, in which each character represents a virtue and a sin. For example, you may never see Emmie as often because she represents illness and insomnia. On the other hand, Cooper and Van represents dilligence and hope.

I hope to explore this concept further. As I build up my website, a new page will be dedicated to formally introduce all my 7 characters.

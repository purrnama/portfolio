I enjoyed making this one. Mynx puts up a grand performance on the main stage!

I brainedstormed an aesthetic for Mynx's discography. Inspired by cyberpunk midtempo and the pandemic (really), I designed a special rave mask for her. It looks really great, and I hope to carry it forward for future projects.

The rest of her outfit and setting is inspired by San Holo during the pre-album1 era.

'Shepherd to the Stars'

A friend asked me why is she naked.

Serious answer: As I go through my life, chapter after chapter, I've definitely learned a lot about myself, my strengths, my vulnerabilities and my principles going forward. I want to explore more corporeal and symbolical themes, as I capture these thoughts and experiences I've been feeling, and how I might focus on fundamental elements that can invoke certain emotions in my artworks. Nonetheless, I tread a fine line between provocation and solemnity, bringing an aura of mystery to uncover.

Trivial answer: Why not ðŸ˜³

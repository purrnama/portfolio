_During the summer, some of Van's fur would shed, and tufts of orange fur would grow in their place, revealing golden highlights on her hair._

Van Carina, the embodiment of heart and introspection. Despite her alluring odd gaze and poised demeanor, she has been fated with the purity of vessel. Unable to provide, feelings of guilt and dismay filled the air as she was cast away from her former tribe and off she went alone to tread her own path. She took up the ways of trade and travelled to the far edges of the world exchanging goods and collectibles. She fared well, but her heart remains that of a mother's, and she had always longed for a child that will carry on her legacy.

To seek solace in the things she have left, Van must learn to accept defeat in her very own path, temper expectations and reclaim order from the chaos.

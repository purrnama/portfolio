My favourite project of all time. This belongs in a special place in my heart. A culmination of years into digital illustration since 2017.

It is the most definitive artwork of Van and her Turkish culture. I am inspired by the beautiful light ornaments and decorations that can be found in Turkish marketplaces.

At the time I had never felt so alone in my life, and I have been reflecting a lot about myself and what I care about. Van is the embodiment of this inner discovery, which is why she is very special to me. I want to her to feel like a mother at heart, with gentle and loving eyes.

I listened to Angel Lung by Next To Blue and Last Christmas by Wham (San Holo Remix).

_Once in a blue moon, a van cat appears in her caravan, a treasure trove of collectibles from her pilgrimage through the far edges of the Turkey horizon. Will you be on the lookout to find what's in store?_ ðŸŒ™

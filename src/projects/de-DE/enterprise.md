[Lumen](/projects/lumen) II in spirit.

Van's journey in her caravan continues onward. I plan to fuse traditional and futuristic elements together.

Van tells the feeling at the corner of my heart. I never want to bring this up, but I always thought my artworks would reach a larger audience. I appreciate all you individuals who would spend time to write emails to me and watch my small art streams, But I'm feeling there is no clear path to turning this into a real thing.

I am fortunately hedging my bets, and I'm not in a position where art has to become a serious career. I kept going because I believe, that my artworks matter to some very few people left in this world, and I'm _not_ giving up on them.

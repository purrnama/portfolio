_an awakening fate :: one spirit untethering_

misguided by **false expectations** this one was forced to learn the bitter truth. admitting defeat to this one's very own path and carve another. recollect oneself and find hidden meaning. tempered with **newfound knowledge** this one must reclaim order from the chaos.

The end that begins my new personal project, Achernar.

All these years through thick and thin, as I continue to grow as a person, I want to document my thoughts and experiences in a new form of illustrations. Illustrations that tells the astral tale of two kindred spirits and uncover the secrets of how they came to be. A sundance between innovation and heritage.

The style of storytelling will be in a form of _"apocalyptic graphical literature"_, with every new illustration reveals the end that explains very little of its beginning. Timelines are fragmented as you slowly piece them together back in sequence.

Achernar is the brightest star in the Eridanus constellation. The name originated from the arabic phrase _ƒÅkhir an-nahr_, meaning _'the end of the river'_. Appropriately so, as Achernar is located at the very end of the constellation.

My first commission for Subcritical, with proof of payment in the Cardano blockchain.

Subcritical is a prevalent community member in Cardano, hosting many spaces showcasing new projects and news in the Cardano blockchain. He reached out for a Demon Slayer-themed Kitsune mask with a Cardano logo on it. I'm happy how everything turned out.

Crypto is something I rarely ever talk outside the community, because it doesn't fit at all with my audience. It is a polarizing topic especially among artists, so I avoid speaking about it outside of work. Despite that, I remain neutral and accept commissions paid in crypto, mainly in ADA.

By the way, this is not minted as an NFT! Just a regular avatar commission.

Ouughhhh

I am undecided whether I want to add this in my portfolio or not. I guess it would be good to showcase my style range.

The premise is a female version of a friend's Blinx fan sweeper OC with outlandish anime hair saying nya. I went above and beyond.

Occasionally I would draw other people's cool looking OCs out of good will. I'm sure many could relate, that there is an apparent difference between drawing because you want to and drawing because someone asked you to. As someone whose drawings are heavily driven by emotion, I find it hard to feel the same passion and deliver the same quality under different circumstances.

A mysterious being indeed. Well, this is actually one of my Roblox avatar outfits.

That Golden Antlers of Honor are particularly rare. It is rewarded to the first few thousand players that completed the final RB Battles 2020 mission. It took almost 6 hours non-stop trying to beat it. It was so hard before they nerfed it when the little kids started complaining lmao.

Well, I got one. Cope and seeethe

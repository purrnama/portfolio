A piece where I let loose some guilty pleasures!

I recently bought a Nuphy Halo75 V2 mechanical keyboard in pink sakura fizz colour that I simply adore the moment I saw it. I've been quite intrigued with the keyboard rabbit hole, and simply curious to know what it feels to type on a thocky keyboard. And you know what, since I got this Halo, I fell in love with typing again. Furthermore, it comes with a waifu poster and stickers!!

So I dedicate this artwork to this lovely experience. It was supposed to be a semi-realistic study, but somehow it kind of gone a different direction and felt a little more toony. I really want to craft my own anime eye rendering as I mentioned on [Arbiter](/projects/arbiter). Though, I feel like there's always something missing in this artwork. Whatever it may be, I hope I could find it and hone it on my next work.

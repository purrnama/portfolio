Djed is the egyptian symbol for stability. A perfect inspiration for this project featuring Ghost.

Each of my characters have a special item that embeds a special crystal node. These nodes are terminal points for the consortium network, the method in which these Khajiits communicate with each other around the globe. In this case, the node is embedded in Ghost's staff.

I experimented with direct sunlight and subsurface scattering, given Ghost's furless sphynx cat skin.

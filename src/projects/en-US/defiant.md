I made this project to celebrate my move towards working entirely on Linux, with colors inspired by Debian 11 teal and turqoise. It has been some months after I made the switch to Debian 11, and I couldn't be any happier with the performance and experience. Really, Windows just throttles **_on idle_**.

For some time this has been my background for my custom Plymouth. It would appear every time I turn on the computer.

My workflow now consists of mostly open-source software. I only keep a small Windows partition just for the remaining Adobe stuff. _When Linux, Adobe???_ :(

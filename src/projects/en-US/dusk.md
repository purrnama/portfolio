I drew this character 2 years ago and I would love to see how much I've improved by drawing her again.

I'm very inspired by vantablack coating that absorbs so much light that the surface covered by it appears as a very dark void, removing any crevices that would otherwise be perceived under normal light. It would be interesting to see the effect on a cat's fur, with everything else fully rendered!

The owner of the character, TONGALI_GOAT recently retweeted my original fanart of Chocolate. Not long after, they stated they were happy to find my account again since I rebranded to purrnama. I thought it would be a good time to catch up with them. I still have to use a translator to talk to them, and sometimes I may have come across some slight mix-ups, but I always try my best to be accommodating and hospitable as possible.

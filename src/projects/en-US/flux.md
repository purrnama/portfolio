_cycle and choke, through ice and smoke._

_your travels, it ages you._

My mind was on a dead end around 3 months ago. I was really confused about the kind of relationship I'm having with someone, and these stirring emotions began to interfere with my thinking. I laid everything bare, but it was not reciprocated, or perhaps my expectations were never aligned. What became of it was a fight or flight response, and I chose the latter. For the sake of my clarity, I needed time to forget and focus on what mattered.

I never expect this 2 years of my life to be travelling to 2 different countries, yet here we are. One taught to be resilient, the other taught to discover. One tempered me mentally, while the other tested me physically. Regardless, you seize every opportunity to learn and discover, and find out what's in it for you that is worth fighting for and continue living.

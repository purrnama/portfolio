Van Carina as a lovely moon Miqo'te! I love her so much. This was an outfit of hers during the Endwalker MSQ.

Honestly thought I'd wait for the female Hrothgar update before I got on XIV. I may have grown attached to Van's current form. Either way, that Fantasia I got post-ARR is always there waiting until I decide its the right time for her to evolve.

Emerge from the heart of the mountain, and into the outside world.

The next chapter is a world of unyielding terror. Trials and tribulations enough for me to tire these legs and shatter my heart. Tapes of terrible memories play on repeat in my mind. The only way to go is forward, till the inevitable end.

Whatever happens, my failure will not come from a lack of trying.

Cry about it, but the caravan moves on.

Codename Kikazaru

A piece that is supposed to be the third final part of a series based on the three wise monkeys, Mizaru (See no evil), Iwazaru (Hear no evil) and Kikazaru (Speak no evil). It serves as a strong reminder for myself to contemplate on my past mistakes and be mindful of my actions. Past mistakes I simply want to write off as an interim chapter of my life.

Cooper's fur is always complex, due to him being a sandcat. As I experiment further on fur rendering, he always looks different in each artwork. Plus, I tend to reference my own physical form whenever I draw him. I'm taking a different approach to rendering by blocking up large areas of colours and slowly merging and blending the colours together, with each step getting more detailed.

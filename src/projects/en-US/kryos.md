The hunt is never ending.

Kryos (κρύος) is Greek for cold.

A new winter outfit for Van. Weirdly, I experiment with a lot of costume ideas by customizing my Roblox avatar. The UGC stuff provide a lot of options to work with. She's wearing some kind of dress with a corset (lol) which I improvise into some leather armor harness. Rock some chainmail and a traveller backpack and boom, you got yourself a slick looking winter huntress.

The symbol has no particular meaning. I wanted a snowflake-like pattern with a nordic touch.

I don't know, for some reason I'm feeling intimate throughout this project. Just expressing my love for my turkish van cat. I listened to Die For You by The Weeknd while drawing this.

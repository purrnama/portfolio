codename Strix

If you haven't notice already, I lovee God of War. It piqued my interest towards exploring about Norse mythology and all the cool tales and aesthetics. The newest installment Ragnarok will be launching in November.

I have to keep pushing my skills and see how far I've come. And I can truly say this is my best work to date. If you're looking for the latest look of Van, this will be it.

ðŸŽµ the weeknd - i feel it coming (yeah coworker radio music whatever lol)

It's all about the fashion! Tsubaki to me serves as a blank slate towards a new direction of creative expression, a diverging path towards more fun and _exciting_ new ideas, contrary to the heavier themes in Achernar. Lately I've been inspired by the artist 1N7MM on X. They have a distinct bold art style with many interesting characters and outfit ideas. I want to work on something of similar style as a homage to their amazing work.

Summer is back so let's work on a summer outfit! Tsubaki is a mostly a traditional being from an ancient time, but otherwise has no choice but to live in the present future. So I wanted to design something flashy, symbolizing the thrilling future, while being reserved with more traditional themes. Laces work really great for this. I also mix and match certain items from her original outfit and gave them a summer spin to keep it consistent with her style.

I've been playing FFXIV lately, figuring out what the deal is and also having fun with friends. Honest to earnest, I am quickly red-pilled.

I drew this for the free company I was in as a token of my appreciation for all the help lifting me off the ground with the game, quite literally with Chocobo ferries. I am inspired by the style of Yoshitaka Amano, the logo illustrator for the iconic Final Fantasy titles. They are massively mesmerizing in its simplicity, and I aspire to mimic that approach.

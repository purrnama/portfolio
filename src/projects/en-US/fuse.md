A special piece made as a submission for a dynamics contest, in which you create a artwork using these emojis 🌈 🍬 🪸 ☄️ as inspiration!

I took this opportunity to create a new design for my oldest OC, Mynx Amina. I turned her into an interstellar scuba diving DJ with fun and kawaii aesthetics.

From a technical perspective, I've experimented a lot with the filter layers in Krita, particularly tonemapping to create the comic-like effects.

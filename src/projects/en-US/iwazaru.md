ðŸŽµ NewJeans - Ditto (Zekk Remix)

Contemplating on a broken heart. My mind shattered into complete reset as the facade I played lead into a path of depravity. I've been radio silent and simply been out and about experiencing the things I've missed out on. The impromptu visit to the streets of Jakarta several days ago felt like a dream, as I experience a new world that felt so familiar yet so profoundly thought-provoking.

Mynx Amina, a flare of halcyon and pure excitement, contradictively embodies my grief and heartbreak. She does not exist in the real world, but rather dwells in the subconcious realm. She is neither a friend or foe, just the only person who would listen, when there is no one left to trust. She doesn't advise you or incite you, but go along with how you would figure things out.

The world moves on even when I'm not there, which leaves everything to me, and how I choose to live the life I want.

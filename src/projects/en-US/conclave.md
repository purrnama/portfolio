This one of my most definitive projects to date. I take inspiration from Rebirth, the Quixel Megascans real-time demo. The nordic post-apocalyptic setting truly got me going. Van's caravan is unlike any caravan, it is a wandering node.

This project pushes the limits in making everything look realistic and yet stylized.

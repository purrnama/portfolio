ðŸŽµ clayekea - charmer

1/3 of a mini series

Thank you for ruining my life, or perhaps if I could reword it, making me see to how bad it has been.

There were eyes watching me, scrutinizing my every move. Somehow I'm supposed to behave or _react_ a certain way to fulfill some unwritten obligations. Every interaction is simply me thinking 3 to 4 times the ways how I could possibly be misunderstood.

At the end of the day, I don't know who they are and what they are capable of. But what I do know, is they are willing to use it against you.

I had the wrong expectations and gave away too much, and all that is left is a gaping hole. Simply too much.

It's been fun I guess, but its long overdue that I focus on what really matters, for the ones I truly care for.

NNN special.

I am unironically taking this month very seriously. My past few months has been a descend towards unending madness. If there is any way to redeem myself and become better this year, I have to find solace in a different avenue. I need Him to hear me.

Personal gripe aside, I've been inspired by art noveau designs and a particular artist named TriatelX on Twitter, who draws anthros in that unique style. This artwork is based on a Swedish propaganda poster that I found very amusing. The folded paper effect is made using a mask.

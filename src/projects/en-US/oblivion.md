one night I was in a state of complete emptiness. Locked frozen in time as I reflect on how I came to be in this present day. The ever-lasting struggle to do your best in your every wake, it's frustrating and daunting.

I could not cry it out. All these years of tempering has only petrified my heart, along with the sadness within, leaving myself numb and heavy. I am left to wonder what might happen next as I traverse the sea of life, despite its flow being crystal clear.

But I must tread onwards, for there are things in life, be it God, family, and friends, that give me reason to be the best of myself. I bring my all to bear.

_to dispel the lie of my own making_

bonus music: alaska sargent - all I need ft. oathbarerr

despite the things it has given me, and the places it has taken me, there is always fear and doubt in my heart, about my abilities.

I know the people I talked to mean only the best for me, but as soon as I hear such trivializing remarks (because let's be honest, it definitely is) I knew its something I must overcome with my own strength, and not from others.

to reassure myself, I made this piece through pure instinct, a mindless wander from an empty slate and see where it leads, and what my heart tells me. And she was there again.

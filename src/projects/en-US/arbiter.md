The way I perceive my characters have somewhat changed recently. I would think they are reflections of myself, but when I think about the mistakes I've made and the consequences it created, its as if my shortcomings are only hindering their potential to be greater. To that end, I no longer wish to impose myself in that fantasy, and they are free to do what they want, to live their true selves in their world, and so shall I in mine. This artwork is based on the acceptance of this fact.

I'm blending my rendering style with more anime-like aesthetics, especially on the eyes. I've been binge watching on a lot of Hololive vtubers and in turn Japanese artists, and I'm simply mesmerized by the variety of details despite how derivative they might seem from afar. I hope I can bring the attention to detail on some of my works too. Who knows, it might appeal to a broader market.

Also, definitely not influenced by Rover from Wuthering Waves :3

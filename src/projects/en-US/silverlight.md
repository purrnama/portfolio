ðŸŽµ shameless. - come find me

how are you?

how long has it been?

from the moment our paths diverge?

was it out of malice, or just cowardice?

but one thing is certain.

nothing good and nothing bad will happen again.

a stagnation of memories, drifting further with the flow of time.

while we carry our burdens and legacy with us through the depths of space.

nature's brute force. the primitive and succint way forward.

and truthfully, im doing okay.

i've been missing the world, and the part of me whose potential energy has yet to uncover.

and i fill that void with tangible, meaningful growth.

and im happier in this new life.

so im sorry, and thank you.

for the millionth time.

whenever our paths converge again,

in a different timeline,

in a different circumstance,

in a different wavelength,

as strangers,

i would like to share these insights with you.

All in a day's work, but hey, at least you have echoes to help you!

A submission for the Wuthering Waves All Silent Souls Can Sing Fan Creation Event. I'm sure a lot of people are on their knees for Zani since her drip marketing, me included!

I'm taking this opportunity to draw her and giving a shot at the fan art contest. This artwork has been quite a journey, breaking boundaries and experimenting new lighting in contrast with the manga style lineart.

Content wise, I try to highlight the theme of living around echoes as a normal part of life in Ragunna, including the workplace. Competition is quite fierce with all these amazing artists, but I'm optimistic on landing something substantial. üôè

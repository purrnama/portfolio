A recurring theme this month revolves around purity, chastity and abstinence.

An important fact about Carina is that she is barren, which means she is unable to bear children. While it is undoubtly a heavy topic that I could never fully understand, I feel it is important to recognize such a thing exists in a person, and therefore to recognize that there is more to life than needless pleasure. Carina helps me explore these different avenues of beauty and appreciate the worth of others.

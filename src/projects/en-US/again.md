ðŸŽµ Alaska Sargent - Center of Attention

The number of times I fumble over the same mistakes continue to shackle and bind me. They come as voices in my head, telling the worst possible things. The dissonance between mind and reality is often numbing. Unless I act on it, the consequences will begin to rear its ugly head.

And now, I have nothing left to lay bear.

The only thing left is my faith. In this journey it will take me to the wrong people, as well as the right people. They will manipulate me, support me, trick me, love me, and yet they all bring something for me to learn from. Faith will guide me to the things I'm capable of, and give me purpose in this world, to bring benefit to the ones I care for.

And now, I have everything I need.

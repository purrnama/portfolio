I hold photos near and dear to my heart. They are us when we once were. When we were happy, when we were sad. Figments of a past life and a story worth retelling. They remind of us of who we were, and how much we have changed.

The elusive charm of a photograph, its spontaneous nature, is what I try to capture. What appears to be obscurity of context brings opportunity for your mind to piece together, like rekindling a long-lost memory.

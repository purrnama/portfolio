ðŸŽµ acloudyskye - Off And Away

Move forward with courage, because you are not alone.

Tsubaki Nishimura, an oni from the past who got stuck in the present. To find her way back home, she works as an archivist in hopes of finding clues about her past. Along the way, she may sometimes stop to discover the wonders of today.

Tsubaki to me embodies the feeling of nostalgia, yearning and longing for the perceived unobtainable. What might seem impossible to some, with clever insight, collective effort, and a stroke of luck, is not so far-fetched after all.

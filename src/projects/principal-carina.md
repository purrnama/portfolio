A reference sheet in quite a while! Principal will be a long series of reference sheets for my characters.

This project is a turning point for my new rendering methods for projects that follow. To be frank, I've been looking **respectfully** at a lot of Prequel fanarts, and ones from the artist named Makkon caught my attention. He was generous to provide a guide to his rendering process, which is widely recognised as _the industry standard_ way of illustration. While he doesn't consider himself the go-to guide for drawing, I'd be thankful to him for being my first step closer to being more _professional_, so to speak.

In this project I followed the process closely, utilizing blending modes for shadow, ambient occlusion, sky, bounce, so on and so forth. In the end, I am quite happy with the results. It feels like a step above my previous projects. I will carry these new skills forward and optimize my workflow further.

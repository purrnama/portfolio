1 out of 4 of the Prequel collection, featuring Rajirra. I personally love a super classy lady, how I depicted Rajirra in this piece, with an updo hairstyle, lounging in a bar as she stares with uninterest. She may have been a jerk to Katia, but she is firm with her beliefs and priorities, which I respect.

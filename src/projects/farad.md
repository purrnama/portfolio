Mynx the Russian Blue is in her room, jamming on some new lo-fi beats. The setting is inspired by San Holo's stripped down versions of Worthy and Show Me. Very warm and comfy.

Also, shameless AMD Ryzen plug lol. I just got this Lenovo Legion 5 that runs on AMD, and it has been a great experience using it. It's a funny story how I ended up with this laptop, but it's a story for another time. God sets you a path that you would never expect.

I like this project. It is heavily inspired by Madeon's Good Faith album. The elements are taken from the Borealis live performance.

The design and aesthetics created by The Architects have been phenomenal, and it's a big influence for many of my design and typography works.

There is a certain charm in hiding certain parts of you from sight, as if it's a treasure kept hidden, only for those deserving.
